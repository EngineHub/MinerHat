MinerHat
========

MinerHat is a packet analysis utility and proxy for Minecraft. As of writing,
it only has been updated for Minecraft 1.4.

It runs on port 1111. You cannot change this. After the program has
started (start via terminal), use 'host' and 'port' in console to change
the host/port to connect to.

I could not get the maven built pom to work yet. It's on my todo list.
